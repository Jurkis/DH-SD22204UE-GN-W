Camera model was selected the first from cameras list.

# Extend your Wi-Fi network range
One more thing. Despite that camera developer says that camera Wi-Fi range is about 100, 200 or 300 meters, it does not work such range. 

To extend Wi-Fi range just use network extender. I use Netis Wi-Fi network extender [E1](https://www.netis-systems.com/About/lists/id/31).
